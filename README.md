# FAQ Accordion UI with JavaScript

This is a simple and responsive FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) Accordion built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.

Each FAQ item expands on click to reveal the answer and collapses again on another click. The arrow icon rotates for a visual cue, and the answer area animates smoothly using CSS transitions.
